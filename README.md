Web interface allowing you to configure network settings(static IP only currently) from a web interface with an Arduino with a Wiznet interface, and store retrieve them automatically from EEPROM. 
Have only tested on an Arduino UNO. Based off of JO3RI.be's original script, but with some work done to make it compile properly. Requires the textFinder plugin for URL parsing(code could be re-wrote, but works). Original code link:
